# Integration of third-party algorithms for microscope scans on CancerCenter.ai platform
This repository contains the information on the API for integrations third-party algorithms with the [CancerCenter.ai platform](https://cancercenter.ai/for-pathologists/).
It provides the [documentation](/Documentation.pdf) as well as sample implementations for the servers on both sides of the protocol, which can be used for developing
the algorithm compatible with the API.

The sample API implementation doesn't really allow you to deploy the model in production. If you want to deploy your model on the CancerCenter.ai platform, please contact us
at [info@cancercenter.ai](mailto:info@cancercenter.ai)
